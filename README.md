# Description
This is a python keylogger that uses Windows python API hooks to capture keyboard inputs. The base script `logger.py` is basically an exact copy of TCM's Python 201 lesson "Project #3 - Keylogging a System". All other scripts in this repository are modifications of the original script to fit different scenarios.
